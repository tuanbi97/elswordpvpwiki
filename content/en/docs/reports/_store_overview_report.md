## Select Date Range
On the top of the Store Overview page, choose Date filter as below:

- Last 7 days (not including Today)
- Today
- Yesterday 
- This week (from Monday to Yesterday)
- Last week 
- This month (from 1st day of this month to Yesterday)

Note that **Previous period** is the consecutive period in the past with the same length of time with the current period. For example, you view the report from 9th Nov to 15rd Nov, the comparison period is from 2nd Nov to 8th Nov.

## Select Stores
By default, the Store Overview report shows data of all stores that you are granted access to. 

To view the chart for one single store, click on the Store drop box in combo chart to show the store list.
