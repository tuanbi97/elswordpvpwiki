  With roles alone, users still cannot access any store information. In this section we will introduce how Palexy allows Admin to share store permissions to users.
---

For more detail on how permission and roles work together, please refer to [Roles and Permissions ]({{< ref "_roles_and_permissions.md" >}})


1. To share store permissions to users, firsly go to Store Access Management page.
2. In Store Access Management page you can see a list of users and their permissions.

    - In Stores box, you can select a set of stores that you want to share permissions. 
    - In Usernames or Emails box, you can input the username or email or users you want to share the stores to. 
    - We also support to input multiple users, all you need to do is to separate usernames by comman, for example if you want to share to user1 and user2, you can type in: user1, user2. 
    - In permission box, select READ or READ & WRITE permissions depending on your need.
