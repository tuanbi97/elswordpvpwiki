Welcome to Palexy documentation page! This document shows you how to use our platform in the most effective way.

## About Palexy
Palexy is an advance analytics platform that helps customers to optimize their offline stores using all avaiable data sources. Our product turns your existing CCTV cameras into a powerful data source using our patent-pending AI & Computer Vision technology. 

Our technology captures and analyzes the entire customer journey: how many people pass by, how many customers walk in, what they try on, how they interact with sales staff, which sections they visit and for how long. 

We also automatically detect and sort shopper profiles into age and gender groups at every store location. Unlike sensor-based footfall counter solutions, our Machine Learning algorithms exclude staff from counting and treat every shopper as one unique traffic source, even if they walk around the store multiple times.

All of your data are gathered into a central place securedly in our platform to provide actionable insights about overall store's health anywhere, anytime
