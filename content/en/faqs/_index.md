### 1. What is store code and where can I find it?
Upon setting up your store, Palexy engineers may ask for your store code to complete the setup. Usually companies will use their internal store ID as store code since then it can be used to link stores in Palexy system to your system. For all of our export reports, we will include the store code so that you can map our stores to stores in your system.
